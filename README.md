# Web Scraping
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with a script for web scraping data from the Mexican government's open data portal, located at https://datos.gob.mx/, using the Python libraries BeautifulSoup and Selenium. The script utilizes the capabilities of both libraries to navigate and extract the desired information from the website such as dataset titles and file formats.

BeautifulSoup is used to parse and navigate the HTML structure of the website, allowing the script to target specific elements on the page and extract the relevant data. Selenium is used to interact with the website, simulating a web browser and allowing the script to handle dynamic content and interact with JavaScript elements on the page.

## Make sure to run it with:
```
    python==3.7.3
    pandas==1.4.2
    selenium==4.7.2
    bs4==4.11.1
```
